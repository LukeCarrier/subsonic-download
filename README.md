Subsonic download user script
=============================

In his infinite wisdom, Sindre removed download links for media items from the
Subsonic web interface. It turns out I actually rely on this more than I would
have expected, so I've thrown together a hacky user script to add it back.

Notes
-----

I only tested this in Greasemonkey, so it may not work correctly in other
browsers/extensions. Feel free to throw a pull request at me if it's broken, but
please don't expect me to fix it.
